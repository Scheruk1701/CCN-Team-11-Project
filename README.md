# CCN-Team-11-Project

This is the final project of Group 11 belonging Computer Communications and Networks class of Fall 2023

NeuMan: Neural Human Radiance Field from a Single Video We present a unique framework for reconstructing the human and the scene from a single in-the-wild video, which may be displayed with fresh human stances and viewpoints. We train two NeRF models using a video shot by a moving camera: a person NeRF model and a scene NeRF model. We use current approaches to determine the approximate geometry of the individual and the scene in order to train these models. Using these preliminary geometry estimations, we can generate a warping field from the observation space to the canonical pose-independent space, which is where we train the human model.
